it's a demo project just to help one of my friend

This is a project purely build in angular js
no need of backend language or any database to store data.

frontend framework : angular js

data table: ui grid (formerly known as ng-grid)

backend : firebase

angular js is one of the strongest frontend MVC framework, best for SPA(single page application)

firebase is online real time database which support three-way binding too. ( like whatsapp)

firebase also provide user authentication feature with many options


To use this application for your personal purpose ,
all you need to do login at https://www.firebase.com/login/

then create an application at: https://www.firebase.com/account/#/

then change the firebase root URL with your application name. :

var ref = new Firebase("https://<YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseio.com");

and you are all good to go.
 For experimental purpose you can host your web app on firebase itself too.
 or you can just deploy ur web app any host with out any  backend server or any database tool that all will be taken care by firebase.
